## Documentation Standards Applied

Each notebook includes:
- ✓ Clear overview with "What", "Why", "When"
- ✓ Architecture context (layer, dependencies)
- ✓ Detailed explanations of concepts
- ✓ Well-commented code
- ✓ Visual examples and plots
- ✓ Performance notes
- ✓ Practical usage patterns
- ✓ Summary with key takeaways
- ✓ Cross-references to related notebooks

## Import Pattern (New Architecture)

All notebooks use updated imports:
```python
# Layer 1: Primitives
from workbench.primitives import signal, frequency, phase

# Layer 2: Core
from workbench.core.zeta import zetazero, ZetaFiducials
from workbench.core.quantum import QuantumClock

# Layer 3: Analysis
from workbench.analysis.performance import PerformanceProfiler
from workbench.analysis.errors import ErrorPatternAnalyzer
from workbench.analysis.convergence import ConvergenceAnalyzer
from workbench.analysis.affinity import TimeAffinityOptimizer

# Layer 4: Processors
from workbench.processors.spectral import SpectralScorer
from workbench.processors.holographic import holographic_refinement
from workbench.processors.optimization import SublinearOptimizer
from workbench.processors.compression import FractalPeeler, HolographicCompressor
from workbench.processors.ergodic import ErgodicJump

# Layer 5: Generation
from workbench.generation.code import FormulaCodeGenerator
```

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Creating Remaining Notebooks
- Create utilities_3_optimization_toolkit.ipynb (large, 5 demos)
- Create techniques_1_core_processors.ipynb (very large, 8 demos)
- Create techniques_2_ergodic_jump.ipynb (medium, 1 demo)

### Option 2: Batch Create with Scripts
- Use Python scripts to generate remaining notebooks programmatically
- Faster but less interactive review

### Option 3: Incremental Approach
- Create one more notebook now
- Review and adjust approach
- Continue with remaining two

## File Cleanup Pending

Once all 5 new notebooks are created:
- Move old demo_*.ipynb files to deprecated/
- Update NOTEBOOK_PLAN.md
- Test new notebooks (if dependencies installed)

## Benefits of Consolidation

- **Before**: 16 notebooks
- **After**: 5 notebooks (69% reduction)
- **Organization**: Clear utilities vs techniques split
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive explanations throughout
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and extend
- **User Experience**: Clearer learning path
