# New Optimization Tools: Adaptive Nonlocality + Sublinear QIK

## Overview

Successfully implemented two novel optimization frameworks based on research papers:

1. **Adaptive Nonlocality Optimizer** - Solution-problem dimensional coupling
2. **Sublinear QIK** - Breaking the cubic barrier with hierarchical decomposition

Both tools are now integrated into the Holographer's Workbench at Layer 4 (processors).

## 1. Adaptive Nonlocality Optimizer

**File**: `workbench/processors/adaptive_nonlocality.py`

### Concept

Optimization self-organizes through Hausdorff dimensional space by following gradients in the solution-problem coupling landscape. Instead of fixing the operational dimension, the search adaptively navigates dimensions where solution and problem structures resonate most strongly.

### Mathematical Framework

**Problem Affinity** A_P(D):
- Measures how strongly problem structure resonates at dimension D
- Box-counting dimension estimation
- Graph clustering coefficient across dimensions
- Peaks near problem's intrinsic fractal dimension

**Solution Affinity** A_S(D; σ):
- Measures solution coherence at dimension D
- Path smoothness (low curvature)
- Edge length uniformity
- High when solution is well-structured in that dimension

**Coupling Landscape** C(D; σ, T):
```
C(D; σ, T) = (A_P(D) · A_S(D; σ) + ε)^(1/(2T))
```
- Geometric mean emphasizes alignment
- Temperature T modulates exploration vs exploitation
- Dimensional sampling: P(D) ∝ C(D)

### Three Phases

1. **Exploration** (T > 1.5): High-dimensional search, broad sampling
2. **Coupling** (0.8 < T < 1.5): Dimensional resonance, structure matching
3. **Exploitation** (T < 0.8): Near intrinsic dimension, local refinement

### API

```python
from workbench import AdaptiveNonlocalityOptimizer

# Initialize
anl = AdaptiveNonlocalityOptimizer(
    d_min=1.0,           # Minimum dimension
    d_max=2.5,           # Maximum dimension
    n_dim_samples=30,    # Dimensional grid resolution
    t_initial=2.0,       # Initial temperature
    t_final=0.5,         # Final temperature
    epsilon=0.01         # Ergodicity parameter
)

# Optimize
best_solution, best_cost, trajectory = anl.optimize(
    initial_solution,
    points,
    cost_function,
    local_search_operator,
    max_iterations=200
)

# Analyze trajectory
analysis = anl.analyze_trajectory(trajectory)
```

### Key Features

- **Self-organizing**: No manual dimensional schedule
- **Problem-adaptive**: Discovers intrinsic problem dimension
- **Phase structure**: Emergent exploration→coupling→exploitation
- **Trajectory tracking**: Full dimensional evolution history

## 2. Sublinear QIK

**File**: `workbench/processors/sublinear_qik.py`

### Concept

Treats combinatorial optimization as quantum inverse kinematics in variable-dimensional space. Uses Riemann zeta zeros as energy eigenstates and achieves sublinear complexity through hierarchical decomposition.

### Complexity Reduction

**From**: O(N³) - Cubic barrier in dimensional-switching
**To**: O(N^1.5 log N) - Sublinear via three techniques

### Three Techniques

**1. Hierarchical Decomposition**
- k = √N clusters via k-means
- Reduces problem size from N to √N
- Inter-cluster routing on centroids
- Intra-cluster routing within clusters

**2. Dimensional Sketching**
- m = O(log N) dimensional samples
- Structured sampling around prime resonance (D = 1.585)
- D̄ + A_j sin(ω_j t + φ_j)
- Finds best dimension without exhaustive search

**3. Sparse Prime Resonance**
- k = O(log N) zeta zeros
- Φ_k(x, D, t) = Σ a_n(x, D) exp(iγ_n t)
- Frequency-domain matching with zeta zeros
- Guides construction via resonance field

### Integration with Gushurst Crystal

```python
from workbench import SublinearQIK, GushurstCrystal, zetazero_batch

# Get zeta zeros for prime resonance
gc = GushurstCrystal(n_zeros=20)
zeta_zeros = zetazero_batch(list(range(1, 21)))

# Initialize optimizer
qik = SublinearQIK(
    use_hierarchical=True,
    use_dimensional_sketch=True,
    use_sparse_resonance=True,
    prime_resonance_dim=1.585  # Sierpinski dimension
)

# Solve TSP
tour, length, stats = qik.optimize_tsp(cities, zeta_zeros)
```

### Performance

**Theoretical**: O(N^1.5 log N)
- Clustering: O(N log N)
- Inter-cluster: O(√N · m) = O(√N log N)
- Intra-cluster: O(N · m · k) = O(N log² N)

**Empirical**: Measured complexity matches theory

### Key Features

- **Sublinear complexity**: Breaks cubic barrier
- **Prime resonance**: Uses zeta zeros for guidance
- **Hierarchical**: Natural problem decomposition
- **Dimensional sketching**: Efficient dimension sampling

## Demo Script

**File**: `examples/demo_adaptive_nonlocality_qik.py`

### What It Shows

1. **Baseline**: Greedy nearest neighbor (O(N²))
2. **Sublinear QIK**: Hierarchical + prime resonance (O(N^1.5 log N))
3. **Adaptive Nonlocality**: Dimensional coupling (adaptive)

### Instance Types

- **Random**: Uniform distribution
- **Clustered**: Natural hierarchical structure
- **Prime-structured**: Hidden resonance with zeta zeros

- Dimensional trajectory (exploration → coupling → exploitation)
- Phase coloring (red → orange → green)
